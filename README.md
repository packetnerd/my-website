## A Static Website About Myself and Cybersecurity

I'm working on rebuilding this site from the ground up (to actually work and do something). It will likely include a blog about my personal projects and cybersecurity topics, as well as some other cool things.

The goal is to build the HTML & CSS code using the Hugo framework, making for a more feature rich and elegant user experience.
